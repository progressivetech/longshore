# Irritating script that must be run to ensure that the backup that runs
# on the host as the longshore user has read permission to all files. The
# problem is that the file upload code in CiviCRM that operates in the 
# CiviCRM Mail screen will upload files with the mod 0600 which will be
# owned by the longshore-php user, not the longshore user. All of those
# files should be placed i files/civicrm/custom.
#
# Run onces a night (prior to the backup). Should take at most a few
# minutes.
